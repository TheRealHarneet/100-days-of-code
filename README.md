# 100-days-of-code

### Day 1: October 20th 2020,Tuesday

Add intro section talking about how I want to become an SWE 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about basic HTML practices, learned how to create forms, the general syntax different types of tags (div,body,footer,etc). I knew a bit of this from highschool so I just breezed through the 28 sections of it in around 30 minutes but nevertheless, I did learn some new things. Things such as you can use an <a> tag and link it to a section in your webpage by doing <a href ="#sectionidhere"></a>, really enjoying this and looking forward to learning more. 
  

### Day 2: October 20th 2020,Tuesday

**Today's Progress** : I spent quite a bit of time today just focusing on the CSS, I have the basics down its honestly not difficult at all, I'm just learning this so I can understand the basics of flexbox and grind and then move onto understanding boostrap. Ultimately I do wanna make a very strong website and I think this will help me through it. Let's continue on the journey. I'm worried that I might lose determination but I'm definitely not losing it any time soon.
